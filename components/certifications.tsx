        <Certification photo="/kate.jpg" name="Kate Teeple" title="Director, Design Operations - Health Union" info="After working with Matt for almost 5 years at Health Union, I can confidently say that his skillset is incredibly varied and it has no bounds. From creating beautiful custom illustrations that evoke emotion to coding unique experiences for online communities, Matt proved that he is up for anything. I would need more than two hands to count the number of times that Matt saved the day with his quick problem-solving skills and tactical talents. Matt not only jumped in to bridge the gap between coding and design but also made it easy for the rest of our team, who didn't have much coding experience, to utilize code by creating easy-to-use module generators in GitHub. I would highly recommend Matt to any company looking for a multi-talented designer and coder, he'd be an amazing asset to any team."/>
